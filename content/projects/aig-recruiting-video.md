Their aim is to attract talent across the world to work in their Denmark branch. \n\n\nThe challenging aspect of this film is that we shot it in just one go. Filming a video with no stops or breaks presents many obstacles. For example, the script might be misdelivered, an actor might slip up, the lighting might fail, a loud noise in the building might occur, and then you have to reshoot the entire thing. Thankfully, we successfully filmed this in just a few takes. This all came down to the production planning and execution."
