Alexander and Daniel started The BikeBuddies at the beginning of 2019, shortly after they came back from their Bachelor Exchange Program. Their mission has been to help students save money on overpriced bikes and rental subscriptions and make sure their customers are well equipped and ready to enjoy the Danish biking culture.
