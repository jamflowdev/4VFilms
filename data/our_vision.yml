History:
  title: "History"
  content:
    - "4V Films was founded in 2019 by Head videographer, Patrick Bates. Patrick's vision for developing the digital assets of small businesses stems from his own experiences within video production."
    - "After being invited to the Middle East to learn more about how Dubai's leading production house operates, Patrick quickly learnt what it takes to work on a commercial level and to transform brands. Having taken sole responsibility for numerous projects, big and small, with clients such as Audi, Emirates and BMW, Patrick discovered a burning passion that changed his world."
    - "He moved to Copenhagen in 2018 when offered a spot at Copenhagen Business School. During his bachelor, he was surrounded by many small businesses who all shared one thing in common, they lacked high quality, consistent content."
    - "Realising his unique skillset and passion for creating, 4V Films was born with the sole aim to completely transform small businesses, supply them with a wealth of digital assets, help them grow and provide value to others."
