  title: History
  content:
  - 4V Films was founded in 2019 by Head videographer, Patrick Bates. Patrick's vision
    for developing the digital assets of small businesses stems from his own experiences
    within video production.
  - After being invited to the Middle East to learn more about how Dubai's leading
    production house operates, Patrick quickly learnt what it takes to work on a commercial
    level and to transform brands. Having taken sole responsibility for numerous projects,
    big and small, with clients such as Audi, Emirates and BMW, Patrick discovered
    a burning passion that changed his world.
  - He moved to Copenhagen in 2018 when offered a spot at Copenhagen Business School.
    During his bachelor, he was surrounded by many small businesses who all shared
    one thing in common, they lacked high quality, valuable and consistent content.
  - Realising his unique skillset and passion for creating, 4V Films was born with
    the sole aim to completely transform small businesses, supply them with a wealth
    of digital assets, scale their online presence and rapidly grow their business.

  quote: I want to unlock small businesses potential by scaling their digital impact,
    so they can transform, grow and contribute to society with their unique product
    or service.
