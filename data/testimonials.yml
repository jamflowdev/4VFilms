      are so attentive and professional, they will always make you the priority. \n\nWe
      bought the first impressions package which was perfect for us since we had little
      video content. Within just one week, we had a ton of videos, from welcome videos,
      marketing ads, team interviews - we were totally covered\n"

      I'd highly recommend working with Patrick and his team.

  - text: We've worked with other production companies in the past, but actually none
      of them had such a structured way of working and a model like 4V Films has,
      which just makes us feel like they know what they’re doing

  - text: What made me happiest working with Patrick and 4V Films, was that I barely
      had to do anything. It was such an independent job and I can just say this is
      what I want done, not really giving directions and still get an amazing result
