      I'd highly recommend working with Patrick and his team.
      It's been a super enjoyable process and the end result was really nice. It's a video we can see being used for a lot of different things.

      of them had such a structured way of working and a model like 4V Films has,
      which just makes us feel like they know what they’re doing.

  - text: What made me happiest working with Patrick and 4V Films, was that I barely
      had to do anything. It was such an independent job and I can just say this is
      what I want done not really giving directions and still get an amazing result.
